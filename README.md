In this assignment, I have built a multiple linear regression model to predict shared bike demand, aiding BoomBikes (a bike rental company) in adjusting their post-pandemic strategy based on demand dynamics.

Key points:  
* Prepped the data for modelling, mapped choice variables and created dummy variables for categorical var.  
* Split (train_size 0.7) and scaled the data using scikit-learn. 
* Using RFE, weâ€™ve built 5 models with the final model presenting R-Square (81%) and Adjusted R-square (81%). Our VIF is within the acceptable range i.e <5
* Performed Residual analysis and Model Evaluation

Found some interesting insights! The key one being that most bike-rentals happen when the **weather is _Clear_, during Fall season (_September!_) and during weekdays (esp. _Thursday_)** . More on that in the notebook.

This one was a bit tough, but fun :)
